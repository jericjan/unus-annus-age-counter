# The Unus Annus Age Counter
So as you know, Unus Annus is dead. And so I thought to myself, "What if I made an unus annus timer but instead of it being a countdown, it would be the number of days you've been alive timer. That's pretty much it. There's a bunch of residue stuff from the other unus annus countdown timer i made, and most of the code is just copy-pasted from the Unus Annus website, so there's a bunch of residue stuff that it doesn't really need but it breaks when I remove so I didn't really bother with them anymore. I can't code shit lol.

To-do list:
- add custom text
